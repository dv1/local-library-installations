Quick setup
===========

To build Opus and GStreamer with make -j5, run:

./build.sh -p opus=1.0.1 -p gstreamer=1.0.2 -j 5

(the -j X argument is optional)

NOTE: the order MATTERS. FIRST comes Opus, THEN GStreamer. Otherwise, GStreamer won't find the Opus binaries, and will not build the associated plugins.
Use the version numbers of the packages that you want. In this example, it would build GStreamer 1.0.2 and Opus 1.0.1.


How to use the built installation
=================================

Run: source ./env.sh
Then, gst-inspect-1.0 and friends should be available.


How to clean up
===============

Just delete the staging/ and installation/ directories. downloads/ too if you are sure you don't need the downloaded stuff.
(Deleting the first two but not the last is useful for rebuilding, since it omits the downloading stage.)
